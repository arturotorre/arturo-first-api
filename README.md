# arturo-first-api
Project created to code my first API.

Welcome to my very first API using Javascript/NodeJS! :)

Requirements:
- Javascript
- Nodejs
- Postman (Downloadable App)

1st Step: Downlad all the files in this repository and save them in a folder that is easy for you to access.

2nd Step: Open index.js in your IDE (VS CODE preferably), open a new terminal inside of it and run the command npm i to install all the dependencies that are inside this project.

3rd Step: Once all the dependencies are installed, run command "nodemon index.js" in your terminal.

4rd Step: Use the documentation provided in the following link to see the endpoints you can use in this APi - https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6048123/2s9XxsTv8Y#9908dc7c-bc60-4f81-b2dc-66f704bd829a

*IMPORTANT*

- There's a little error in the "delete all" endpoint documentation, the correct PATH is http://localhost:3000/all.
- THIS IS NOT FOCUSED ON API SECURITY YET. The scope of this project is only to create an API with valid/responsive endpoints.
